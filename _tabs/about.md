I am Dr. Raymond Kwong Wai-man, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Social Sciences at Hong Kong Metropolitan University. I obtained my Ph.D. in Economics from Newcastle University, UK, a M.Sc. in Finance from The City University of Hong Kong (CityU), and a M.Phil. in Computing from the Hong Kong Polytechnic Unviersity (HKPU) underpinning my expertise in both finance and technology.

As a CFA charterholder and a Certified Financial Risk Manager (FRM), my professional qualifications reflect a deep commitment to financial analysis and risk management excellence. These qualifications play a pivotal role in my research and teaching, where I specialize in integrating financial knowledge with technological advancements.

My research is focused on the intersection of finance, technology, and sustainability. I have led and participated in significant projects, such as exploring Green FinTech Innovation, assessing the microstructure in stock markets, and incorporating virtual reality into business and tourism education. These initiatives contribute to academic knowledge while addressing contemporary challenges in finance and education.

Through this blog, I aim to simplify complex financial and technological concepts, share insights on sustainable finance, and discuss the dynamic field of educational technologies. Join me in exploring these compelling and ever-evolving areas.
